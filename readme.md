# Unemployment Analysis with Python 📉

This project focuses on **analyzing unemployment data using Python** to uncover trends, patterns, and insights through data analysis and visualization. It is a beginner-friendly data analysis project that demonstrates how real-world socio-economic data can be explored using popular Python libraries.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Unemployment is a key economic indicator. In this project, we analyze unemployment data to:
- Understand unemployment trends over time
- Compare unemployment rates across regions
- Visualize the impact of time and geography on employment

The analysis is performed using **Python**, with a strong focus on **data cleaning, exploration, and visualization**.

---

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains unemployment-related statistics such as:
- Region / State
- Date or Time period
- Unemployment Rate
- Estimated Employed / Labour Participation (if available)

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and processed using **Pandas**.

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. **Import Libraries**
2. **Load the Dataset** using Pandas
3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Renaming columns
   - Formatting date fields
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summary statistics
   - Correlation analysis
5. **Data Visualization**
   - Line plots to show unemployment trends
   - Bar charts for regional comparison
   - Heatmaps for correlation analysis

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- Unemployment rate over time
- Region-wise unemployment comparison
- Correlation heatmap between economic indicators

These visualizations help transform raw data into meaningful insights.

---

## ✅ Key Insights

- Identifies periods of rising and falling unemployment
- Highlights regions with higher unemployment rates
- Shows relationships between employment-related variables
